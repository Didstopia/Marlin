# Custom Marlin 3D Printer Firmware for Ender 3 V2 + BTT SKR Mini E3 V3.0

This fork of Marlin is primarily used for building very specific, custom builds of the Marlin firmware.

The upstream branches (bugfix-2.1.x and 2.1.x) are automatically kept up to date with upstream Marlin, and the firmware is automatically built when changes are detected.

Additionally, there are _many_ variations of the custom firmware, which you can find in the build artifacts of this repository's [Actions page](https://github.com/Didstopia/Marlin/actions), ranging from different displays and UIs to direct drive, probing and much, much more.

For more information, see the [build workflow](.github/workflows/build-btt-ender3v2.yaml), the [custom build script](.github/workflows/scripts/configure_build_script.sh), and the [Actions page](https://github.com/Didstopia/Marlin/actions) for the latest builds.
